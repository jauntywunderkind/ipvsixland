# Neighbor Discovery for IPv6

In ipv6, Neighbor Discovery provides:

> IPv6 nodes on the same link use Neighbor Discovery to
> discover each other's presence, to determine each other's link-layer
> addresses, to find routers, and to maintain reachability information
> about the paths to active neighbors

One of ipvsixland's core responsibility is providing [neighborhood discovery](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861) for nodes to run discovery on, across the variety of ipvsixland links.
