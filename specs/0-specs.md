# Specifications

Hello, welcome to the ipvsixland specifications. ipvsixland is a substrate for running ipvsix internally within the browser and exteriorly between browser and browser and finally between browser and server. It is believed that by creating an environment where things may use IPv6 for themselves, to contact others, some of the conjoined monolithic systems of today can be simmered down into more independent components using common and conventional network technologies to talk with each other.

In this [`specs/`](/specs) directory are specifications that stake out values core to ipvsixland implementation, and some architectural decisions that stem from those specifications.
