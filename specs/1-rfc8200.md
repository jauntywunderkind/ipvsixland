# RFC 2460 Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6)

ipvsixland as a substrate intends, foremost, to ape Internet Protocol v6. Any relevant runtime context of the web should be afforded ways to acquire an address, and use that address.

# Core terminology

[The core ideas of ipv6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8200#section-1) should all be brought out in ipvsixland. From that terminology we can begin to understand ipvsixland's intents better:

|: term    :|: ipv6 terminology :|: ipvsixland's goal for this term :|
|---|---|---|
|node       | a device that implements IPv6. | ipvsixland ought allow for any particular instance of a web runtime to host a diverse array of ipv6 nodes that can communicate across links to other nodes. |
|router     | a node that forwards IPv6 packets not explicitly addressed to itself. [See Note below]. | any web runtime ought be able to host multiple diverse routers that operate on a variety of links |
|host       | any node that is not a router. | any web runtime ought be able to host multiple diverse routers that operate on a variety of links |
|upper layer| a protocol layer immediately above IPv6.  Examples are transport protocols such as TCP and UDP, control protocols such as ICMP, routing protocols such as OSPF, and internet or lower-layer protocols being "tunneled" over (i.e., encapsulated in) IPv6 such as IPX, AppleTalk, or IPv6 itself. | ipvsixland primarily intends to acts a substrate for very high level protocols, explicitly defining their operation (ex: [`./rfc7540`](./2-rfc7540.md)) |
|link       | a communication facility or medium over which nodes can communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately below IPv6.  Examples are Ethernets (simple or bridged); PPP links; X.25, Frame Relay, or ATM networks; and internet (or higher) layer "tunnels", such as tunnels over IPv4 or IPv6 itself. | ipvsixland intends to provide operation across a variety of links, foremost being postMessage like interfaces which are used for inter-web-runtime communication. It additionally will include inter-machine link technologies. |
|neighbors  | nodes attached to the same link. | neighboring across many diverse links should be possible for all runtime types |
|interface  | a node's attachment to a link. | ipvsixland allow a node to have multiple interfaces, which is especially important since so many connections of web runtimes are point to point |
|address    | an IPv6-layer identifier for an interface or a set of interfaces. | ipvsixland's core addressing scheme follows the ipv6 address identifier |
|packet     | an IPv6 header plus payload. | ipvsixland assumes underlying transit layer that allows it to ignore some standard ipv6 packet contents, such as checksums, while also providing additional signalling not always in ipv6 packets |
|link MTU   | the maximum transmission unit, i.e., maximum packet size in octets, that can be conveyed over a link. | there is no link mtu in ipvsixland, the underlying links are expected to perform packetization |
|path MTU   | the minimum link MTU of all the links in a path between a source node and a destination node. | there is no path mtu in ipvsixland, as routers are expected to relay packets across links that do not require packetization |
